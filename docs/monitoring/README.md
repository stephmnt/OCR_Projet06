# Monitoring Captures

These files are snapshot artifacts for the monitoring deliverable.

- drift_report.html: report generated by monitoring/drift_report.py (sample-size 5000).
- runbook.md: triage et actions quand une alerte drift apparait.
- plots/: feature drift plots + score distribution + prediction rate.
- predictions_sample.jsonl: sanitized example of production logs.
- logs_storage.png: snapshot of the logging storage format.

Notes:
- Drift alerts are gated by minimum production volume (see report badge).
- Data quality metrics appear when logs include `data_quality`.
